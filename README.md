# crashie — a little failure in a box

Crashie is a Command-Line Utility that exits with a random exit code after a configurable delay. Use when you
want to test restart behaviors or anything that requires an application to fail.

```plain
Sleeping for 12.72 seconds, then exiting with code 130
Exiting with code 130
```

## Usage

### Usage Example

If you want to randomly fail with a SIGINT (code `130`) or SIGKILL (`137`) after 10 ± 2 seconds, run:

```bash
crashie --sigint --sigkill --delay=10 --delay-stddev=2
echo $?
```

### Running via Docker

To run crashie via Docker, use e.g.

```shell
docker run --rm sunside/crashie

Provide command-line arguments as if you were running it locally:

```bash
docker run --rm sunside/crashie --sigint --sigkill --delay=10 --delay-stddev=2
echo $?
